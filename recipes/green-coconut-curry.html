        <li>1 cup / 100g Broccoli (65g) - chopped</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Start by adding cilantro stems/roots, garlic, ginger, jalapeno, onion, lime zest to a blender and make a puree. (Please note: Add only 1/2 tablespoon of ginger, if you add too much the dish will turn bitter. Also, thoroughly wash the cilantro roots and stem to get rid of any dirt.)</li>
        <li>Transfer the puree to a deep pot. Add the spices, cooking oil and cook over medium heat until it forms a thick paste and the oil starts to separate - which means it's nicely roasted. Then add the coconut milk, water, salt and bring it to a boil. Once it starts to boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and cover and cook for about 20 minutes - for the flavours to develop.</li>
        <li>Uncover and add the vegetables and tofu. Turn the heat to medium or medium high (depending on the heat of your stove) and cook for another 5 to 6 minutes uncovered, until the zucchini is just slightly soft but still has a bite to it. Cook the gravy to the desired consistency. Add the broccoli, snap peas and cook for a few seconds and turn off the heat. Please note we don't want to over cook the broccoli/ snap peas, it will continue to cook in the hot gravy even after turning off the heat.</li>
        <li>Enjoy it with freshly steamed rice or as a soup. This recipe is perfect for meal prep and stores well in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. </li>
    </ol>
