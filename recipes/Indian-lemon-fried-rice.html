    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>To cook rice</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1+1/2 cup / 300g WHITE BASMATI RICE</li>
        <li>2 cups / 500ml Water</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoon Cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Mustard seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Cumin seeds</li>
        <li>15 to 20 Curry leaves - fresh/dry/frozen</li>
        <li>1 cup / 130g Onion</li>
        <li>1 cup / 150 Red bell pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups / 170g Snow peas</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon / 9 grams Ginger - finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Turmeric</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon Cayenne Pepper or to taste (OPTIONAL)</li>
        <li>2 to 3 Tablespoon Lemon juice </li>
        <li>3/4 cup / 30g Cilantro leaves/li>
        <li>2 teaspoon Sesame oil/li>
        <li>1/3 cup / 50g Roasted peanuts/li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the basmati rice a few times until the water runs clear and soak for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once soaked strain the rice and transfer it to a wide pan and add water. Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat and cook it for about 15 minutes or until the rice is cooked.</li>
        <li>Uncover and fluff the rice with a fork. Then set it aside for it to cool down.</li>
        <li>Now heat a pan and add 3 tablespoons of cooking oil and let it heat thoroughly. Once the oil is heated, reduce the stove heat to low and then add the mustard seed. (Reducing the heat will prevent the seeds from burning). When the mustard seeds start to crackle, then add the cumin and curry leaves and give it a stir and fry it for a few seconds. (Please Note: If you add the mustard and cumin seeds together, the cumin will burn before even the mustard seed crackles do be careful there).</li>
        <li>Now add the chopped onion, carrot, bell pepper, salt and turn the heat to medium. Fry until the onion starts to caramelized. Then add the finely chopped ginger, turmeric, cayenne pepper and fry for another 1 to 2 minutes to get rid of the raw flavour of the turmeric. 
        </li>
        <li>In the mean time, break any lumps in the rice. Add the snow peas, rice, salt to the pan and mix everything thoroughly. Turn off the heat and then garnish with lemon juice, cilantro leaves and sesame oil. Mix well and add roasted peanuts. Cover and let it sit for 3 to 4 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
